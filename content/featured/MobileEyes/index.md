MobileEyes is a mobile application that makes it easy to discover upcoming protests, rallies, or activism eventsâ€”known simply as "Springs" within the app. When users arrive at the listed location, the app will allow them to "Check In", which adds a flower to the Spring's visual garden. As more and more activists assemble, the Spring thrives, which encourages even more people to join in and grow the movement.
